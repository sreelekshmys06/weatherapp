# Weather Application

## Description
This is a simple web-based Weather Application that allows users to enter a city name and view the current weather details.  
The application fetches real-time weather data from a public weather API and displays the temperature and weather condition in a clear format.

This project is developed as part of **Day 4 Task** to understand API calls, JSON data handling, and clean program structure.
